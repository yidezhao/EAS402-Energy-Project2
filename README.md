# EAS402-Energy-Project2

The following project shows an economic analysis of using space mirrors for power generation on earth. Here, we consider 3 cases: the normal, the conservative, and the progressive cases. 
I calculate the discounted net present value for all cases. The NPV vs IRR graph shows the economic feasibility of the system.

Reader and play with the parameters to see the effect.
